<h2>Why I do what I do.</h2>
<p>
    I've always had a strong interest in how things worked growing up. Taking apart every single toy I had and doing my best
    at learning how it worked and rarely putting it back together was my daytime activity. After a while I would run out
    of toys to take a part so the last thing was to try to figure out how the family computer worked (Which was running
    Fedora RedHat and  dual booting SuSe Linux at the time). I entered a new world at that point.
</p>
<p>
    Starting the journey at 8 years old with <a href="http://hackthissite.org">HackThisSite.org</a> the community has
    taught me more than I could ever ask for. I have tried to learn everything there is with computers, including small
    electronics, programming micro-processors, Network Security, Ethical Hacking, Routing & Switching Protocols,
    3D Modeling, OpenGL W/ extensive Linear Algebra, Software & Web Application Development, etc.
</p>
<p>
    I couldn't get enough of it, there is so much to learn and technology never seems to wait for me to catch up.
    Not only do I love knowing how things work, I love making things; I like to make things elegantly, efficiently,
    and using best practices. It's being able to create something out of nothing that makes me accomplished.
